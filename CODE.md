# Code
### Our Code is split into two parts:
- #### Code for the Fischertechnik-Controller: [Click here](./dev/)
- #### Code for the Raspberry Pi: [Click here](./raspberry/)
---

### Fischertechnik Code:
The Code for the Fischertechnik-Controller is for steering, driving, and pathfinding via the Sensors. You can find all the used Parts [here](./DOCUMENTATION.md#table-of-contents).

#### Development:
The Code was developed via a Blockly-Code-Generator used for the "Coding" and uploading on the Fischertechnik Controller. This Program is called "[ROBO Pro Coding](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mxpk52r734c?hl=de-de&gl=DE)" and is a In-House Fischertechnik Product. It also is the only IDE usable to program, connect to and upload programms to the Fischertechnik Controller itselve.
